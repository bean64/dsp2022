Am I on the right track?
    What would you consider finished?
    What would you think you want in the documentation?
    What evaluation criteria are you going to use?
how functional do you want the demo
    realtime?
noise rejection, any ideas?
    criteria for success?
what do you think of the current state of the project?
    
I have prototypes for each individual part
    Clearly feasible?

Next meeting?

Paperwork???
