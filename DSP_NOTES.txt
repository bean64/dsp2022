Thread A:
plays sound every N seconds, records time sound last played

Thread B: scans FFT feed until loud sound is detected, either records latency
or spits stuff out into the screen buffer and calls display function

Issues:
1 - multipathing?
2 - high frequency detection?
3 - reliability of FFT / detection method?
4 - ethical concerns w/r/t hearing damage and children
5 - software architecture - parallel threads with interrupts or spin eternally?
